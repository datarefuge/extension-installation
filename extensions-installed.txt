As root,
I downloaded the master zip from https://github.com/GSA/ckanext-datajson (commit 177c9d8719964feed341541aae9a4d1009944be5 to be exact) and unzipped it into /root/ckanext-datajson. 
cd ~/ckanext-datajson
mv ckanext-datajson-master /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/ckanext-datajson
And then I followed the instructions on the githup site
